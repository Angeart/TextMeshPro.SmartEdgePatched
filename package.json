  "description": "*** READ BEFORE UPGRADING ***\n---------------------------------\nThis preview version of the TextMeshPro package is for users seeking to use both UI Toolkit and TextMeshPro in the same project.\n\nDO NOT UPGRADE to this new release unless you are planning on using UI Toolkit and sharing resources between TMP and UITK.\n\nThis new release uses new asset types that are no longer included in the package and now instead included with the Unity Editor itself. As such, you will no longer have access to the source code for these assets, editors and other related script files.\n\nIn order to share resources between TMP and UITK, existing TMP resources such as TMP_FontAssets, TMP_SpriteAssets, and other TMP assets will need to be converted to these new internal asset types along with remapping of their GUID.\n\nAll scripts and project files referencing these TMP assets will be updated via the Unity API Updater. Since these changes cannot be undone, please BE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR PROJECT before updating to this new release.\n\nOnce the Unity API Updater has run, you will need to restart the Unity editor for this asset migration process to complete.\n\nTMP Essential Resources and TMP Examples & Extras have been updated in this release and should be re-imported.\n\n--------------------\n\nTextMeshPro is the ultimate text solution for Unity. It's the perfect replacement for Unity's UI Text and the legacy Text Mesh.\n\nPowerful and easy to use, TextMeshPro (also known as TMP) uses Advanced Text Rendering techniques along with a set of custom shaders; delivering substantial visual quality improvements while giving users incredible flexibility when it comes to text styling and texturing.\n\nTextMeshPro provides Improved Control over text formatting and layout with features like character, word, line and paragraph spacing, kerning, justified text, Links, over 30 Rich Text Tags available, support for Multi Font & Sprites, Custom Styles and more.\n\nGreat performance. Since the geometry created by TextMeshPro uses two triangles per character just like Unity's text components, this improved visual quality and flexibility comes at no additional performance cost.",
